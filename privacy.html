                    <p>When contacting with us through our website and upon your consent, we collect, as a minimum your e-mail
                        address. From our counterparts, for the fulfillment of the purposes of the contract, we collect indicatively the
                        following personal data: full name, e-mail address, telephone number, etc. When visiting our premises, we may
                        also have access to Wi-Fi connection data, if used, as well as to video surveillance system material (CCTV),
                        which operates in our premises, where relevant signposting exists, for the protection of persons and goods, in
                        accordance with the respective legislation and the guidelines of the Hellenic Data Protection Authority. The
                        relevant material is stored for seven (7) days, after which it is automatically deleted. In case we find an incident
                        during this period, we isolate part of the video and keep it for one (1) more month, in order to investigate the
                        incident. In case legal proceedings arise, the relevant material shall be stored until a final judgement is issued.</p>
                    <p>The aforementioned personal data is processed only for the following purposes: a) communication with us, at
                        your own request, b) receiving information regarding our services and any other information you wish to know, c)

                        property and goods) and g) to comply with obligations imposed by laws, regulations or Community legislation
                        (including anti-money laundering laws) and the establishment or defense of a legal claim. Your personal data
                        shall not be used for purposes other than those listed above, unless we obtain your prior consent or unless this is
                        required or permitted by applicable law.</p>

                <div class="row">
                    <p>A video surveillance system (CCTV) operates in our premises in order to protect people and goods, by virtue of
                        which the possibility of capturing images, not audio, is provided. Only limited and strictly authorized persons have
                        access to the video surveillance material, who are bound to maintain confidentiality. The deletion of the data takes
                        place automatically on the 7th day of recording, however in case of an incident related to security, the material
                        may be kept beyond the above period, in accordance with what is defined in the corresponding instructions of the
                        Personal Data Protection Authority. The cameras focus on points where there are objects/goods that need
                        protection, and on the entrances/exits of the premises, as well as on any point that appears to need protection
                        (such as cash registers), for security reasons without focusing on areas where it may be excessively restricted the
                        privacy of individuals, respecting personal data.</p>
